# TowelHost AU Compatibility Issues - Fixed

## Latest Update: Enhanced Robustness (v1.0.4)

Added comprehensive error handling and detection for problematic components:
- **Permissions validation** - Detects unreadable component files
- **Bundle structure validation** - Verifies .component is actually a bundle
- **Multiple instantiation attempts** - Tries all plugin descriptions in component
- **Case-insensitive search** - Handles naming inconsistencies
- **Directory scanning** - Finds plugins even with mismatched names
- **Detailed error messages** - Guides users on fixing security/validation issues
- **Extensive debug logging** - Shows exactly what's being tried and why it fails

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Hardcoded Sample Rate and Buffer Size** (CRITICAL)
**Location**: `PluginLoader.cpp:82`

**Problem**: Plugin instances were created with hardcoded values (44100 Hz, 512 samples), but the actual audio device might use different settings, causing:
- Sample rate mismatches
- Buffer size conflicts
- Plugin initialization failures

**Fix**: Added proper sample rate and buffer size handling with defaults.

---

### 2. **Missing Input Channel Data** (CRITICAL)
**Location**: `AudioEngine.cpp:38`

**Problem**: Only output buffer was passed to `processBlock()`, no input audio provided:
```cpp
// OLD - only output channels
juce::AudioBuffer<float> buffer(outputChannelData, numOutputChannels, numSamples);
```

This caused:
- Plugins expecting input audio to crash or fail
- Audio effects that process input to malfunction
- Undefined behavior with input channel data

**Fix**: Created proper buffer with both input and output channels:
- Allocates buffer with max(inputChannels, outputChannels)
- Copies input data to buffer
- Processes through plugin
- Copies processed data back to output
- Clears output when no processor active

---

### 3. **Inadequate Bus Configuration** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Location**: `Main.cpp:186`

**Problem**: `enableAllBuses()` alone doesn't properly configure bus layouts:
- Some AUs require specific bus configurations
- Channel layout mismatches
- Missing fallback configurations

**Fix**: Implemented comprehensive bus configuration:
1. First calls `enableAllBuses()` for initialization
2. Attempts stereo I/O layout
3. Falls back to mono if stereo fails
4. Handles output-only plugins (synths)
5. Logs configuration status for debugging

---

### 4. **Buffer Initialization Issues** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Location**: `AudioEngine.cpp:39`

**Problem**: Audio buffer wasn't cleared before use, potentially containing garbage data.

**Fix**: Added `buffer.clear()` before copying input data to ensure clean state.

---

### 5. **Missing Channel Configuration Validation** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Location**: `AudioEngine.cpp:117-123`

**Problem**: No validation of channel counts from audio device.

**Fix**: Added validation with fallback to stereo (2 channels) if device reports zero channels.

---

### 6. **Insufficient Debugging Information** (LOW PRIORITY)
**Location**: Multiple files

**Problem**: Limited logging made troubleshooting difficult.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive debug logging for:
- Plugin descriptions found during loading
- Bus configuration attempts and results
- Channel counts and audio settings
- Plugin instantiation success/failure

---

## Additional Improvements

### Robust Error Handling
- Validates plugin descriptions before instantiation
- Checks for empty plugin names
- Logs all available plugin descriptions

### Better Audio Processing
- Bounds checking on channel indices
- Proper handling of mismatched channel counts
- Clear output when processor is null

### Configuration Flexibility
- Supports mono, stereo, and output-only plugins
- Gracefully handles various bus configurations
- Falls back to safe defaults

## Testing Recommendations

To verify these fixes work with your problematic AUs:

1. **Check Console Output**: Look for DBG messages showing:
   - "Found X plugin description(s)"
   - "Successfully configured [stereo/mono] I/O layout"
   - Channel count and sample rate information

2. **Test Different Plugin Types**:
   - Audio effects (need input + output)
   - Synthesizers (output only)
   - Utility plugins (various configurations)

3. **Monitor for Specific Errors**:
   - "Failed to create instance" messages
   - Bus configuration failures
   - Channel mismatch warnings

4. **Compare Before/After**: Test the same AUs that previously failed intermittently.

---

## Potential Remaining Issues

If problems persist, consider:

1. **AU Validation State**: Some AUs might need the component to pass validation
2. **Threading Issues**: GUI updates vs. audio thread conflicts
3. **Resource Conflicts**: Multiple instances or system resource limits
4. **AU-Specific Quirks**: Some manufacturers implement AU specs differently

---

## Next Steps if Issues Continue

1. Enable more verbose JUCE debugging
2. Test with known-good reference AUs (e.g., Apple AUs)
3. Compare behavior in other AU hosts (Logic, Ableton, etc.)
4. Check for AU component corruption (reinstall plugins)
5. Test with AU validation tools
